Roots CSS
---------

Roots css is a terse, feature-rich css library built on top of stylus. It's a child of the [roots build system](http://github.com/jenius/roots-cli), but is totally old enough to live on it's own. It can be integrated as a plugin for stylus or included manually.

Detailed documentation coming soon. The code is commented pretty thoroughly though, if you want to comb through it.

Note: native-style mixins should always be used unless at root level or unless there are no parameters.

#### To Do
- grid system
- add extra optional params where i can
- capybara tests
- sprite mixin
- @2x images
- auto media queries
- background-position-x and y overrides with background-position: 0 x
